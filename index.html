        <p class="mainSection1P0">
            I am a extremely qualified and passionate computer 
            engineer with high outstanding achievements. I have 
            flexibility moved from creating code on a microcontroller
            to launch a rocket for the NASA MINDS competition to delevoping 
            this website for myself. If you are intrested in getting into

            <p class="mainSection2Main0P0">
                This is a rocket I programmed for the NASAMINDS compitation with the microcontroller Raspberry PICO connected to a Raspberry Pi which is accessed with a computer via SSH. 
                How it works is I programmed the Raspberry PICO to recive serial input from the Raspberry Pi 3 which is a command that will instuct the PICO to burn a fuse connected to 
                the rocket which will light it to send it off to space. This project won as a finalize for NASA in the NASAMINDS compitation.

            <p class="mainSection2Main1P0">
                This is a Tetris game I made with an SoC on the FPGA Nexys A7-100T. I have programmed a song that gets higher pitch depending on what score you have and 60 individual 
                controlable blocks that make the shapes you can rotate. I did this project for my final project for my advanced Verilog course and I enjoyed making it.

            <p class="mainSection2Main2P0">
                This is a TicTacToe game I made in my freshman year in college. There is a interactable GUI, score tracking system, a way to save and create files to keep track of your 
                games, and a unbeatable artifical intellegence. This project was one of the first of many personal projects I did in my space time on github.
