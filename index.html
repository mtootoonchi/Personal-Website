        <p class="mainSection1P0" id="mainSection1P0ID">
            I am an extremely qualified and passionate computer 
            engineer with high outstanding achievements. I have 
            flexibility moved from creating code on a microcontroller
            to launch a rocket for the NASA MINDS competition to developing  
            this website for myself. If you are interested in getting into

            <p class="mainSection2Main0P0" id="mainSection2Main0P0ID">
                This is a rocket I programmed for the NASAMINDS competition with the microcontroller Raspberry PICO connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 which is accessed with a computer via SSH. 
                How it works is I programmed the Raspberry PICO to receive serial input from the Raspberry Pi 3 which is a command that will instruct the PICO to burn a fuse connected to 
                the rocket which will light it to send it off to space. This project won as a finalize for NASA in the NASAMINDS competition.

                This is a Tetris game I made with an SoC on the FPGA Nexys A7-100T. I have programmed a song that gets higher pitch depending on what score you have and 60 individually 
                controllable blocks that make the shapes you can rotate. I did this project for my final project for my advanced Verilog course that I enjoyed making.

            <p class="mainSection2Main2P0" id="mainSection2Main2P0ID">
                This is a TicTacToe game I made in my freshman year in college. There is an interactable GUI, score tracking system, a way to save and create files to keep track of your 
                games, and an unbeatable artificial intelligence. This project was one of the first of many personal projects I did in my spare time on Github.
